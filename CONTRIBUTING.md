# Welcome to the mack contributing guide

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already . If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/MrPowers/mack/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/MrPowers/mack/issues) to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, make sure that no one else is already working on it, so you can get assigned. After that, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Before you commit, install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
